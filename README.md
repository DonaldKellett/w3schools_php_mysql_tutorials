This PHP file summarises what I have learnt about using PHP to manipulate SQL Databases in W3Schools.  Most of the code is commented out so if you want to test it out you will have to uncomment it.  Anyway, I'm only uploading this for my own reference so please don't expect this file to do anything useful.
